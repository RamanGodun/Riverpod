  /*
  autoDispose + ref.keepAlive() pattern:
  - If the data is successfully fetched, it gets cached.
  - If an error occurs, it tries fetching again (without caching the error state).

  If "ref.keepAlive();" is placed before the data fetching, the data will be fetched
  in the background, even if the user navigates away from the page before the data is fetched.

  Before using `keepAlive`: If the user navigates to a page, and data isn't fetched yet,
  then immediately navigates away, the provider will be disposed.

  After using `keepAlive`: If the data is fetched at least once, it will be cached, even if the provider is disposed.

  ? Difference between "keepAlive: true" option:
  - `keepAlive: true` ensures that the provider stays alive indefinitely,
    whereas `ref.keepAlive()` only keeps the data alive until it is next needed and accessed.
